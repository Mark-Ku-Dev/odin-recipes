    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,
      made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more
      traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my
      mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.
      I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and
      crusty garlic bread.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Beef</strong>: This easy lasagna starts with ground beef. You
        can use ground turkey for a lighter option
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spaghetti Sauce</strong>: Use store-bought spaghetti sauce
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cheeses</strong>: You'll need cottage cheese, mozarella, and
        Parmesan.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Eggs</strong>: Eggs help bind the cheese mixture together. Plus,
        they lend moisture and richness.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Seasonings</strong>: Season the easy lasagna with dried parsley,
        salt, and black pepper
      </li>

        <strong>Lasagna noodles</strong>: Of course, you'll need lasagna
        noodles!
      </li>

    </ul>
