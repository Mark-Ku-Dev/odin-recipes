    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This fabulous cinnamon-raisin French toast recipe should be prepared the
      night before baking. It's always a hit with friends and family and is best
      served with something salty on the side such as bacon or sausage. Enjoy!
      Can also be topped off with real maple syrup for an extra sweet treat.
