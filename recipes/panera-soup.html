    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This fabulous cinnamon-raisin French toast recipe should be prepared the
      night before baking. It's always a hit with friends and family and is best
      served with something salty on the side such as bacon or sausage. Enjoy!
      Can also be topped off with real maple syrup for an extra sweet treat.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Beat eggs, milk, and vanilla extract together in a medium mixing bowl
        and pour over bread. Cover the dish with foil and refrigerate, 8 hours
        to overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion;
        cook and stir until tender and translucent, about 5 minutes. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk 1/4 cup melted butter and flour together in a large saucepan over
        medium-low heat. Continue to whisk and cook, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons
        of milk if necessary to keep the flour from burning, 3 to 4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually add milk while whisking constantly; stir in chicken stock and
        bring to a simmer.
      </li>
      <li>Cook until mixture is thickened, about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Add broccoli, carrots, celery, and sautéed onion; simmer until all the
        vegetables are tender, about 10 to 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in Cheddar cheese until melted; season with salt and pepper to
        taste before serving.
